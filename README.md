ClassProject
============

This is My first Android App which I did as my class project (Year Three).

This application Uses google maps to display road map to Give visitors directions to different points within the University
i.e. helps users locate Offices, Lecturer Halls etc within the university. 

I built the app to help users to easily locate their destinations within Maseno University since offices and lecture halls 
are scattered all over and there is no clear directions making it difficult for visitor and new students to find their
way around the campus.

The App runs on Android Version 2.2 (froyos) and above.
